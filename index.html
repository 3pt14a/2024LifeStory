                    <h3>Meeting My Half-Brother</h3>
                    <p>Some moments in life feel like movie scenes—surreal, nerve-wracking, and filled with emotions you can't quite put into words. February was one of those moments for me. For the first time, I met my half-brother in person.

                    I went to meet him with my dad, lola, and aunt, and honestly, I didn't know what to expect. Would it be awkward? Emotional? Turns out, it was a mix of everything—but in the best way. It wasn't just about meeting a relative; it was about filling in missing pieces of a story I hadn't fully understood before. And while one meeting couldn't make up for lost time, it was a start. A good one.</p>

                    <h3>The Stomachache That Changed Me</h3>
                    <p>Picture this: A night out, good company, a few drinks, and the thought, 'Eh, I can handle this.'' Fast forward to the next morning, and I was curled up in regret, swearing off alcohol forever (or at least until my stomach forgave me). Turns out, there's a fine line between having fun and overestimating your tolerance—and I crossed it. Lesson learned: just because the drinks keep coming doesn't mean you have to accept every single one.</p>

                    <h3>My First Scuba Diving Experience</h3>
                    <p>Santa Fe, Bantayan Island—a place I've always known for its beaches, but in August, I got to experience it in a completely new way. I finally tried scuba diving for the first time.

                    It was just an introductory dive, something to experience rather than train for. At first, I was convinced I'd panic, mess up, and somehow end up floating away. Breathing underwater felt weird, and I had about a hundred 'what if' scenarios running through my head. But once I got past the initial nerves, it was like stepping into another world. Seeing marine life up close, feeling weightless, and just existing in silence beneath the waves—it was unreal. Easily one of the best experiences of my life so far.</p>

                    <p>After years of only dreaming about it, I finally traveled outside the country for the first time! Thailand was everything I hoped for—beautiful sights, amazing food, and just the right mix of excitement and chaos.

                    I went with my mom, but the real challenge came when I had to fly home alone. Navigating airports, immigration, and all the stressful parts of travel by myself was a nerve-wracking experience, but somehow, I made it. Would I do it again? Absolutely—but maybe with less anxiety next time.</p>
